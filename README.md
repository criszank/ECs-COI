# ECs-COI
EC system to coordinate the projects that each one of the members of Hubbell Drafting Team

This software works as follows:

In the main screen all of the new tasks are shown in the left side ordered by priority.
Next to the tasks, the members of the team are shown at the top, with the projects in which they are currently working on below them.

New Tasks:
When a New Task is created, a new window will appear asking for:
-Part Number
-Project Description
-EC Number
-Additional Information

Task assignment and notifications:
The tasks are assigned by dragging them from the "Pending Task" tab to the name of one of the members.
Each time a member gets assigned a new task, the system will automatically notify them.
The task that are below each of the members will be shown by priority.
When external help is needed (Example: Approval of drawings), the system will also notify them.

Tasks Priority:
The priority for the drafter can be changed by dragging them to a higher or lower position. However, the prioriti level ("Low", "Medium" & "High") can only be changed by the creator of the task.

Tasks Order By Priority:
The task with "High" priority will be show in RED and will be the task shown at the top.
The task with "Medium" priority will be show in ORANGE and will be the task shown after the task with "High" priority.
The task with "Low" priority will be show in YELLOW and will be the task shown at the bottom.

Task Information:
The tasks will show a brief description of the project and also the EC number of the project.
When the EC number of a task is clicked, the user will be redirected to the EC System with a search regarding the EC.
